The main goal of this project is to provide tools for
integrating distinct modeling formalisms into a comprehensive
software system.
These models range from the very application defining use
case models to the hardware and software ecosystem models.
Some of these models are for runtime analysis and others
are suitable for compile-time adaptation.
The main goal is to provide an environment where concerns
may be separated as part of architectural design.


The currently used models are a subset of those previously created:

* feature_model/immortals_feature_2017_instance_01.webgmex
* feature_model/immortals_feature_2017.webgmex
* mission_model/immortals_mission_2017.webgmex
* routing_model/immortals_network_2017.webgmex
